## Data storage

- Sharing configurations requires large, publicly accessible storage
  - Even with ILDG; they don't have infinite free storage
- Even for measured quantities, output data are becoming larger than Zenodo will allow
- How do we store all these data?
- How long for?
- How do we make them available?
- How long for?
- How is this funded?

-

## Metadata standards

- $\exists$ ILDG standards for configuration/ensemble data & metadata
- $\nexists$ such standards for measurement (propagators, correlators, flow histories, â€¦) and downstream results
  - Increased overhead in designing bespoke releases
  - Each release slightly different $\Rightarrow$ poor interoperability

-
