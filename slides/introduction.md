## Reproducibility

Same data 
<span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">$+$ same analysis</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2">$\rightarrow$ Same results</span>

* Related concepts: <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  * Replicability: New data $+$ same analysis $\rightarrow$ same results <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  * Robustness: Same data $+$ new analysis $\rightarrow$ same results <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="5" -->

## Open science

The movement to make all research accessible to all levels of society.

Including, but not limited to:

* Publications
* Physical samples
* Data
* Software

-

## FAIR

Research data (and software) should be:

* **F**indable
* **A**ccessible
* **I**nteroperable
* **R**eusable

_Orthogonal to data being open_

# Motivation

-

## Why open science?

* Public funding $\Rightarrow$ Public results
* The ideal scientific process
* Our funders say so

_"Data resulting from publicly funded research should be made publicly available... unless there are specific reasons (e.g. legislation, ethical, privacy and security) why this should not happen"_ â€”[STFC Scientific Data Policy](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/policy/funders-data-policies/stfc)

## Open science accelerates progress

[The war over supercooled water (DOI:10.1063/PT.6.1.20180822a)](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.6.1.20180822a/full/)

* Discrepancy discovered in 2011
* Student hired to revisit computations in 2012
* Code requested in 2013
* Code promised "available on request" in 2016
* Code eventually provided after involvement of Nature editors
* Discrepancy caused by a poor choice of initialisation function
* Findings published in 2017

Was that the best use of 6 years of arguments?

## Why automated reproducibility?

* Communication with words is imprecise
* Papers have limited space
* Human error is inevitable
* Computers are pretty good at doing the same thing every time
